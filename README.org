#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: George Castillo

This is the Emacs setup I use on multiple machines and platforms, both at home
and at work.  It is heavily based on the work of [[https://github.com/danielmai/.emacs.d][Daniel Mai]] and a web
presentation on using org-mode and use-package to organize an init
configuration.  The video for this can be found [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIuOwIBL-ZU][here]].
